  <b>Zeal Education Society:</b> Conducts the annual Zeal Drag Race which unleashes the racing DNA of the students. As students from other colleges also participate in the event, it fosters the spirit of healthy competition among the students, a much needed quality from a practical perspective. All this is carried out while keeping the fun quotient of such events high!<br><br>

  <b>As a result of the noble values imbibed in them as part of the Zeal Culture, our students have in the past collected food grains for the drought affected farmers. We donâ€™t just provide a degree that facilitates earning a livelihood- the students leave the campus as citizens who have humane values.</b>
