  <u><i><b> Passion:</b></i></u><i>Bikers are passionate about their bike and bike rides. It is not just about commuting from one place to another. It is about the deep desire to turn on the ignition, accelerate and zoom ahead.</i><br><br>
 <i><u><b> Sense of Freedom:</b></u></i><i>Riding a bike is about the sense of freedom because you are not confined to a box when you are on a bike. You get to feel the world a lot up close and personal.</i><br><br> 


  <u><i><b>Meeting Nice People:</b></i></u> <i>You can make great friends during bike rides. Bike trips can result in meeting nice and like-minded people. Probably that is why bikers have clubs and associations that arrange frequent road trips.</i>
